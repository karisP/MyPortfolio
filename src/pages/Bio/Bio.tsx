                Storytime!
                My name is Karissa. I have been a professional developer for over two years with a startup called Zbox and am starting a new adventure at Detroit Labs. Prior to my career in the software world, I was a ballet dancer and teacher. My passion for the arts has influenced my love for aesthetically beautiful websites. Performing art taught me to be disciplined and detail-oriented. In my search for a new career, I found out that my enjoyment of math translated well into logic puzzles and code. I attended Grand Circus Detroit’s Front-End Bootcamp and started my journey. My team’s final project won the Employer’s Choice Award, and I met my boss that same day. I’ve been primarily a front-end developer, but everyone has to do a bit of everything in a startup. Designer. Developer. Tester. Bug Fixer. I’m very excited in my journey to gain more experience in back-end projects. Outside of work, I enjoy board games with friends, drawing, exercising, and watching anime or sitcoms.
