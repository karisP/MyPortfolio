            Storytime!
My name is Karissa. I have been a professional developer for 2 years now with a startup called Zbox. Prior to my career in the software world, I was ballet dancer and teacher. My passion for the arts has influenced my love for asthetically beautiful websites. Performing art taught me to be disciplined and detailed oriented. In my search for a new career, I found out that the math side of my brain really enjoyed logic puzzles and code. I attended Grand Circus Detroit’s Front-End Bootcamp and started my journey. My team’s final project won the Employer’s Choice Award and I met my boss that same day. I’ve been primarly a front-end developer, but you do a bit of everything in a startup. Designer.Developer.Tester.Bug Fixer.
I’m very excited in my journey to gain more experience in back-end projects. Outside of work, I enjoy board games with friends, drawing, exerciser, and watching anime or sitcoms.
