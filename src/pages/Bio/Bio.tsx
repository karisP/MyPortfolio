            Storytime! My name is Karissa. I have been a professional developer for over 4 years. Prior to my career in the software world, I was a ballet dancer and teacher. My passion for the arts has influenced my love for aesthetically beautiful websites. I graduated  from Grand Circus Detroitâ€™s Full-Stack Javascript Bootcamp and started my journey. My first role was in a startup where I got a chance to try a bit of everything. Designer. Developer. Tester. Bug Fixer. While I am a strong front-end developer, I found myself able to go to the back-end to fix a bug or get access to the data that I needed to display. In my next job, I was able to go a lot deeper in my precision of UI development and became known for my eye for design details. I am incredibly passionate about building good team relationships by helping developers communicate with designers and quality engineers. I love learning and mentoring junior developers with their growth journey. Currently, I am open to new opportunities and looking forward to making new connections.
